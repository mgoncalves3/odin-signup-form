# odin_signup_form

The aim of this project is to try and replicate a simple sign up form for a fictional web service.
A design file is given for reference.

At first glance, some of the things I'll practice are:

- Grid page layout
- Positioning with Flexbox
- Backgrounds
- Shadows
- Form validation (probably with JS)
- Simple animations


Also, to expand on the page, I can make the backgrounds more active or add a parallax effect.

I'll try to do this project without using any framework.
