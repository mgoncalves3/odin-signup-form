# odin_signup_form

The aim of this project is to try and replicate a simple sign up form for a fictional web service.
A design file is given for reference.

At first glance, some of the things I'll practice are:

> Grid page layout
> Positioning with Flexbox
> Backgrounds
> Shadows
> Form validation (probably with JS)
> Simple animations


Also, to expand on the page, I can make the backgrounds more active or add a parallax effect.
